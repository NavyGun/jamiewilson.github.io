                <h1>I am ignorant.</h1>
                <p>I know, that’s not something you’d expect to see at the top of a CV. But wearing that ignorance on my sleeve is the biggest reason for the success I’ve had as a designer.</p>
                <p>I’m quick to say it because I’m eager to start asking questions—to start learning something new and solving the next puzzle. I never want to be the person who has all the answers. I want to be the guy that <strong>questions everything</strong>.</p>

                <h2>A little more about me:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I need to be working on difficult problems. It makes me feel alive. If I’m not building something, I get grumpy.</li>
                    <li>I want to apply my branding skills to digital products because I think branding is most effective when it empowers a user to accomplish something, rather than just telling a story.</li>
                    <li>I’m passionate about motion and animation and how it can overcome the shortcomings of touch-screens and inform and modify a user’s behavior.</li>
                    <li>I desire a tight process that focuses on quantifiable results and goals—and allows for iteration based on predefined sources of feedback.</li>
                    <li>I’m very interested in behavioral psychology and how habits are formed. I especially enjoy BJ Fogg’s work and his “tiny habits”.</li>
                    <li>It’s hard for me to understand how some people don’t own a dog, I’m obsessed with black pepper, and I drink high-quality coffee to justify how much of it I consume.</li>

                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <h2>Creative Director</h2>
                <p><strong>Switch Creative</strong> | 2005–Present</p>
                <p>I have provided strategy, creative direction, copywriting and design for a dozen or more branding, web and print projects each year for the past 9 years. I have become extremely proficient in determining the true needs of a client and translating business goals into appropriate visual solutions. </p>
                <p>I am proud of my abilities to very clearly communicate why I made a design decision and how that decision solves a given problem. I am very thorough and meticulous as I believe the details are at the core of an experience; that a brand or product is the sum of it’s tiniest parts.</p>
