**Half** - http://jamiewilson.github.io

====

Half is a project to help designers & developers partner up.

If you've got a project idea that requires skills that you donâ€™t have, we can help. Every other week we send out a list of local projects that need the skills that you possess. Respond to the project listing to team up with its creator.

Currently, we only serve North Texas. To team up with people from around the world, check out Analog: http://analoghq.com/
